:description: EasyRTC OpenSource is: 1) A browser client library written in JavaScript. This client handles the signaling and to a large extent insulates applications from ongoing changes in the WebRTC api. 2) A signaling server based on Node.js. Together, these two components will let you write a simple video conferencing application, or a file sharing application, etc in just a few lines of simple code.

== Install Node.js

The binary packages for node come from https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#debinstall[NodeSource]. I choose to install the latest version which is v7.

* `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_7.x | sudo -E bash -`
* `sudo apt install nodejs`
* `sudo apt install build-essential`

Node is now installed but additional setup is needed to use it fully.

* `sudo mkdir /var/nodes`

== Install the LAMP Stack

This approach uses _tasksel_. _Tasksel_ should only be used during initial setup of a server and not for ongoing maintenance and configuration. It installs all of the software and configurations required for a specific task.

* `sudo apt-get update`
* `sudo apt-get install tasksel`
* `sudo tasksel`
** Check _LAMP server_
** Enter new MySQL root password when asked

== Test the LAMP

=== Test Apache

* Browse to your ip_address or hostname (_servername_) to view the default Apache page
* Enable mod_rewite (needed for WordPress)
** `sudo a2enmod rewrite`
** `service apache2 restart`


=== Test PHP

* `sudo nano /var/www/html/phpinfo.php`
** Add `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`
** Save
** Browse to _servername_/phpinfo.php
* Once it is working, remove the phpinfo.php file for security disclosure reasons.
** `sudo rm /var/www/html/phpinfo.php`

=== Test MySQL

An easy way to test MySQL is to install https://www.phpmyadmin.net/[phpMyAdmin].

* `sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin php-gettext`
* Browse to _servername_/phpmyadmin
* Login with _root_ and the password you set earlier


== Test a Virtual Host

A virtual host on Apache allows Apache to serve websites for multiple domains of a single IP address or interface. I'll demonstrated this using a simple configuration for the atest.com domain.

* Review the default config, `less /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf`
* `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/atest.com.conf`
* Add the following to this new configuration

```
# start atest.COM
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName atest.com
    ServerAlias *.atest.com
    ServerAdmin admin@atest.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www/atest.com/html
    <Directory />
        Options FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>
    <Directory /var/www/atest.com/html/>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        allow from all
    </Directory>

</VirtualHost>
# end atest.COM
```

* Note the DocumentRoot is **/var/www/atest.com/html**. This is where all the website files will go.
* Create a web viewable file
** `sudo nano /var/www/atest.com/html/index.html`

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Welcome to A Test!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Success! This is a test page of the atest.com virtual host settings.</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

* Change file permissions of web accessible files. (Caution: this disables all executable files)
** `sudo chmod -R 644 /var/www`
** `sudo chmod -R ug=rwX,o=rX /var/www`
* Enable the virtual host, `sudo a2ensite atest.com.conf`
** to disable a site use `sudo a2dissite atest.com.conf `
* `service apache2 reload`

Next, is to point the domain at the server's IP address. This is not covered in this document but there are two methods.

1. Use the hosts file
** _/etc/hosts_ on Linux
** _C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\etc\\hosts_ on Windows
2. Set your domain using DNS. This could be your domain registrar or a third party like DNS Made Easy.

== Install WordPress

I prefer not to use the apt system for installing and maintaining WordPress. This application has frequent updates some of which may be critical, so install it from [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/download/) and enable automatic updates. This example uses the amaker.com domain.

**Set your DNS or hosts file to point your domain to the server**

* `sudo mkdir /var/www/amaker.com`
* `sudo cd /var/www/amaker.com`
* `sudo wget "https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz"`
* `sudo tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz`
* Use WordPress as the root for amaker.com
** `sudo mv wordpress html`
* WordPress itself will need to modify files for configuration and updates
** `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data html`

=== Configure a Virtual Host

* Similar to the previous virtual host except that now we must permit mod_rewrite and .htaccess files.
** `sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/amaker.com.conf`
* Add the following to this new configuration

```
# start amaker.COM
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName amaker.com
    ServerAlias *.amaker.com
    ServerAdmin admin@amaker.com

    DocumentRoot /var/www/amaker.com/html
    <Directory /var/www/amaker.com/html>
            Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
# end amaker.COM
```
* `sudo a2ensite amaker.com.conf`
* `sudo service apache2 restart`

=== Add a database

Here we will add a user and database to be used by our WordPress installation. For this example the user and database are named _amaker_.

* Login to phpMyAdmin
* Click the _User Accounts_ tab
* Add a new user
** Make certain to check the box _Create database with same name and grant all privileges_

=== Configure WordPress

The configuration is now completed mostly via browser.

* Browse to _servername_
* Follow the prompts and enter the required information
* Login and browse your new WordPress site


== Backup WordPress Files

Backing up files is an important task in maintaining and recovering your WordPress site. Plugins are available to help with this task but I prefer to automate this task with scripts. First, I will run through the manual process and then share the scripts.

=== Assumptions:

* WordPress sites are located in _/var/www_. This example uses the site _test_.
* Git cloned repositories are located at _/var/local/repos_. The example site uses _test_.
* Offsite backup is stored to an AWS S3 bucket. This example uses _bucket-repos_

=== Manual Initializing Run

==== Git and Clone the Site

* `sudo -i`
* `cd /var/www/test`
* `git init /var/www/test`
* `git add --all`
* `git commit -m "Initial commit of site"`
* `mkdir /var/local/repos`
* `git clone /var/www/test /var/local/repos/test`
* `exit`

IMPORTANT: Since some files contain sensitive information (particularly wp-config.php), the clone should not be public.

==== Sync the Clone to AWS S3

You now have a local clone of your current WordPress files. Now lets sync the clone to AWS S3. This method uses AWS CLI, see more at https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/cli/.

* Install awscli
** `sudo apt install python-pip`
** `sudo pip install awscli`
* Configure awscli, `aws configure`
** You need your AWS Access Key and Secret Access key.
** If you don't have those keys, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-set-up.html

Some of the python scripts also make use of boto3. See https://github.com/boto/boto3 and https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

* Install boto3
** `sudo pip install boto3`
* Since we have already configured AWS CLI, boto3 is already configured also.

Setup the S3 bucket

* Make a new bucket, `aws s3 mb s3://bucket-repos`
* List all buckets, `aws s3 ls`
* List the contents of a bucket, `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-repos`

Synchronize the contents of the local repository with the S3 bucket.

* `sudo aws s3 sync /var/local/repos/test s3://bucket-repos/test --delete`
* Verify, `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-repos/test/html/`

=== Creating a Scripted Initializing Run

Now let's automate that whole process by creating a shell script. First we'll create some text files that are used as input to the script. All of the text files are most easily created automatically, though each may be edited manually. The text files hold one site name per line.

==== Already Initialized Sites

The first file is _s3ed_sites.txt_. This is a list of sites already run through this process. The entries are auto-generated using the following _make_s3ed.py_ script. Call the script with `python make_s3ed.py  > s3ed_sites.txt`

[source, python]
.make_s3ed.py
----
#!/bin/python
"""
make_s3ed.py: Connects to S3 bucket used for repositories to list all currently synced sites. The output is often piped to s3ed_sites.txt
How to call:
python make_s3ed.py  > s3ed_sites.txt
"""

import boto3

S3BUCKET = "ggis-repos"

client = boto3.client('s3')
paginator = client.get_paginator('list_objects')
result = paginator.paginate(Bucket=S3BUCKET, Delimiter='/')
for prefix in result.search('CommonPrefixes'):
    print(prefix.get('Prefix')[:-1])
----

==== All Sites

The second file is _all_sites.txt_, a list of all sites in _/var/www_ that need to be initialized. This can be auto-generated by using a command such as `ls /var/www > all_sites.txt`.

==== ToDo Sites

The third file is _todo_sites.txt_. This file is just the difference between _s3ed_sites.txt_ and _all_sites.txt_. The following python script, _all-s3ed.py_, creates this third file. Call the script by `python ./all-s3ed.py`

[source, python]
.all-s3ed.py
----
#!/bin/python
"""
all-s3ed.py: Generates the set difference to create the todo_sites file.
"""

file1 = "s3ed_sites.txt"
file2 = "all_sites.txt"
file3 = "todo_sites.txt"

with open(file1) as f:
  done =  f.read().splitlines()

with open(file2) as f:
  all =  f.read().splitlines()

todo = set(all).difference(done)
with open(file3, 'w') as f:
  f.write('\n'.join(todo))

----

==== Perform the Initial Git and Sync to S3

Now we use a bash script to control the flow and call various commands. The script is _init_git_then_s3.sh_. This file is called by `sudo ./init_git_then_s3.sh $(cat todo_sites.txt)`

[source, bash]
.init_git_then_s3.sh
----
#!/bin/bash
#
# This script must be run as sudo.
# This script expects site names input from a file.
# Call this script thusly:
# sudo ./init_git_then_s3.sh $(cat todo_sites.txt)

# Some variables that you may choose to change.
SITEDIR="/var/www/"
REPOSDIR="/var/local/repos/"
S3BUCKET="ggis-repos"

SITES="$@"
for f in $SITES
do
    cd $SITEDIR$f
    git init $SITEDIR$f
    git add --all
    git commit -m "Initial commit of site"
    git clone $SITEDIR$f $REPOSDIR$f
    aws s3 sync $REPOSDIR$f s3://$S3BUCKET/$f --delete

done
----

=== Performing the Initializing Run

Let's put it all together.

* `python make_s3ed.py  > s3ed_sites.txt`
* `ls /var/www > all_sites.txt`
* `python ./all-s3ed.py`
* `sudo ./init_git_then_s3.sh $(cat todo_sites.txt)`
* Manually verify that all that your sites are now synced to S3.
** https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3
** View your repository bucket
** Dig through the repositories to verify.

Later, we will create a cron backup script that will run automatically.


=== Ongoing File Backup

== Backup WordPress Databases

Here we perform many of the same tasks only for databases.

=== Assumptions

* WordPress sites are located in _/var/www_. This example uses the site _test_.
* Database dumps are saved to _/var/local/dbdumps_. The example site uses _test_.
* Database names, usernames, and passwords are stored in the various site _wp-config.php_ files.
* Offsite backup is stored to an AWS S3 bucket. This example uses _bucket-repos_

=== Manual First Run

* `sudo -i`
* `mkdir /var/local/dbdumps/`
* `less /var/www/test/html/wp-config.php`
** Find the lines which define the following:

----
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define('DB_NAME', 'dbtest');

/** MySQL database username */
define('DB_USER', 'usertest');

/** MySQL database password */
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
----

* Dump the database, `mysqldump --user=usertest --password=password --opt   --result-file=/var/local/dbdumps/dbtest.sql dbtest`
* Compress the file, `gzip /var/local/dbdumps/dbtest.sql`
* Sync it to S3, `aws s3 sync /var/local/dbdumps s3://bucket-repos/dbdumps --delete`
* Verify with `aws s3 ls s3://bucket-repos/dbdumps/`

=== Creating a Scripted Run

The hardest part of this script is getting the database information from wp-config.php. A python script should do the trick.

* `find /var/www -name wp-config.php -print`
find /var/www -name wp-config.php  | xargs grep DB_NAME
find /var/www -name wp-config.php  | xargs grep "DB_NAME.*'(.*)'"

#!/bin/python
"""

== Upgrade WordPress

Keeping up-to-date with the latest releases of WordPress and its various plugins and themes is important. WordPress is a very popular blogging platform with a history of vulnerabilities but also of quick patches. I have a tickler system that notifies me to check for updates every 3 weeks.

IMPORTANT: Always back up your files and databases before performing a WordPress version upgrade.

=== Via Admin Web Interface

Using the web interface is the easiest way for many users to upgrade their WordPress sites. It does require admin access to the site and also proper file mode settings. After each update step, verify that the site still functions as it should.

* Login to your site as an Admin user
* Navigate to _Dashboard > Updates_
* Select which plugins to upgrade (all?)
* Click Update
* Return to the WordPress updates page
* Select which themes to upgrade (all?)
* Click Update
* Return to the WordPress updates page
* Under the heading _An updated version of WordPress is available._ click _Update Now_
* Review and address any update messages that have been generated


=== Using WP-CLI

WP-CLI, http://wp-cli.org/, is a set of command-line tools for managing WordPress installations. You can update plugins, configure multisite installs and much more, without using a web browser.

TIP: Follow the installation instructions at https://wp-cli.org/docs/installing/

NOTE: Running the sudo command with wp-cli will cause wp-cli to complain. Instead of sudo as the www-data user (which on my machines has no login privileges), I use sudo and then chown on all files back to www-data.

==== Plugins

* Return list of plugin updates available, `sudo wp plugin update --allow-root --all --dry-run --path=/var/www/tosamakers.com/html/`
* Update all plugins, `sudo wp plugin update --allow-root --all --path=/var/www/tosamakers.com/html/`
* Chown files back to www-data, `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/tosamakers.com/html/`

==== Themes

* Return list of theme updates available, `sudo wp theme update --allow-root --all --dry-run --path=/var/www/tosamakers.com/html/`
* Update all plugins, `sudo wp theme update --allow-root --all --path=/var/www/tosamakers.com/html/`
* Chown files back to www-data, `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/tosamakers.com/html/`

==== Core

* Check for core updates, `wp core check-update`
* Update the core, `sudo wp core update --allow-root`
* Update the database, `sudo wp core update-db --allow-root`
* Chown files back to www-data, `sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/tosamakers.com/html/`


=== Scripted Use of WP-CLI

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/tosamakers.com/html/

== Anaconda

Open Data Science Core: Anaconda is a package manager, an environment manager, a Python distribution, and a collection of over 1,000+ open source packages. It is free and easy to install, and it offers free community support. https://anaconda.org/


== Context

Anaconda is well documented and has excellent support. All I include here are a few tasks that I have had to repeat.


== Jupyter


=== Activate and deactivate the environment

* Windows: `activate env_name`
** `deactivate env_name`
* Linux: `source activate env_name`
** `source deactivate env_name`


=== Run a notebook

`jupyter notebook`


=== Save the files of a notebook tree into an archive (assumes system with tar)

* When in a notebook, go to a new cell
* `!tar chzf notebook.tgz --exclude notebook.tgz *` (change notebook to your choice)


=== Download that archive

* From the Jupyter _File_ menu, select _Open_
* Click the archive you created, i.e. _notebook.tgz_
* It will download to your location
* Unarchive to use it


=== Run a command in a notebook

Prepend the command with *!*


=== Build identical environment

The operating systems of the host computers must be similar. This cannot be done to copy a Linux environment to Windows.

First a listing of the environment is needed.

* Try `conda list --explicit`
** If you get an error similar to _Error: environment does not exist: ../anaconda/envs/name/envs/name_
* Then try `conda list -n root --explicit`
* To save the output to a file use a pipe appended to the end of the command, similar to `> spec-file.txt`
* Next, on your anaconda installation: `conda create --name myenv --file spec-file.txt`

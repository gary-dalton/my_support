IMPORTANT: This example uses Windows 10, so change your targets as appropriate.

== Install the Windows SDK

Download the Windows 10 SDK from https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk

Install the SDK by running the downloaded executable.

== Make makecert available

=== Find

In my version of Windows, make cert is found under the folder, _C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin_. Explore to find the exact location of makecert.

=== Copy

I choose to copy the makecert to my C:\bin folder (already in my PATH) but you may choose to add the folder to your path instead.

* In Powershell, `copy "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64\makecert.exe" C:\bin`

=== Add to PATH

Alternatively, you may add the folder to your path.

* `Windows key - r`
* Enter _SystemPropertiesAdvanced_
* Click _Environment Variables_
* Select _PATH_
* Click _Edit_
* Add _C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\x64_ as a new variable in your path

== Using makecert

* Start Powershell as an Administrator

=== Local Certificate Authority

* `makecert -n "CN=PowerShell Local Certificate Root" -a sha1 -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 -r -sv root.pvk root.cer -ss Root -sr localMachine`
** Enter passwords
** Operation should succeed
* Verify via `CertMgr`
** Navigate to _Trusted Root Certificate Authorities_ >> _Certificates_
** Find the certificate named, _PowerShell Local Certificate Root_

=== Generate a Personal Certificate

* `makecert -pe -n "CN=Gary PowerShell Cert" -ss MY -a sha1 -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 -iv root.pvk -ic root.cer`
** Enter password
** Operation should succeed
* Verify via `CertMgr`
** Navigate to _Personal_ >> _Certificates_
** Find the certificate named, _Gary PowerShell Cert_
* Verify your certificate is available, `get-childitem cert:\CurrentUser\my -codesigning`
** You should see your certificate listed

The certificate is now ready for use on the current system. See http://www.darkoperator.com/blog/2013/3/5/powershell-basics-execution-policy-part-1.html for information on how to export it to other systems.


== Change Powershell Execution Policy

TIP: See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170

* Show current execution policy, `Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`
* Change execution policy to AllSigned with a CurrentUSer scope, `Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope CurrentUser`


== Sign some code

Have your freshly written script ready for signing. For demonstration, the script is named example.ps1.

* Start Powershell as a user
* `$cert = @(Get-ChildItem cert:\CurrentUser\My -codesigning)[0]`
* `$file = "\bin\screenshot.ps1"`
* `Set-AuthenticodeSignature $file $cert`

The reply you receive should be similar to:

----
Directory: C:\path

SignerCertificate        Status                  Path
-----------------        ------                  ----
34552NJNH568NJBH3256I    Valid                   example.ps1
----

=== Downloaded Scripts

Downloaded scripts cannot be signed due to special metadata attached to the file. This may be viewed by opening a _cmd_ window and entering the command `dir /r` or `dir /r filename`. You will notice that some files may have a second entry similar to the following:

----
08/27/2015  12:51 PM    372,681 filename
                             26 filename:Zone.Identifier:$DATA
----
